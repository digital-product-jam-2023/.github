# Digital Product Jam

This repository holds Presentations and other learning materials for the Digital Product Jam course run as a joint course between the [Bezalel Academy of Art and Design](https://www.bezalel.ac.il/en), and the [Hebrew University](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=hebrew+universoity&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8). These materials are designed for the development stream of the course, which includes an initial four weeks of web development fundamentals. Team work with the design class starts on week 5 and then the stream of activities largely merge.

# Course description

We all engage with digital products in daily life: we work with them, we express ourselves with them, we communicate through them, we discover information with them.

Students in the course will work in front of clients from the "real world" to learn about their audience as well as their business needs and problems, in order to present solutions in the form of digital products, which they will design, development, and deploy.

Students will work in teams of designers and developers and will experience product development processes, team work, and specifically dynamics between developers and designers in developing working products - just like in product development in the software industry.

# Course goals

- Experience of working in teams of designers and developers that is similar to "real" work in the software industry
- Experience of design, development and product management in front of "real" clients
- Experience of product development for "social good" organizations
- (Development stream) The application of web technologies towards the delivery of a working product
- (Design stream) The application of user interface design, branding and packaging toward the delivery of a working product

# Course outline

## Section 1: Development Fundamentals

**In this section of the course we will:**

- Learn about the web as a platform for digital products
- Learn about the process of product development
- Setup and work with a common set of development tools we will use for the whole course
- Develop and deploy simple apps as a way to learn about how web development works, and as preparation for the main section of the course

**NOTE: home tasks**

Every week in Section 1 of the course there is a home task which involves building and deploying an application. Submission of each of these tasks is as follows:

- All code must be commited to *your* code repository (which is either a "copy" or a "fork" of the original) for this application, hosted on GitHub
- The application must be deployed and accessible via a public URL (this will happen automatically if Vercel is configured correctly for your application)
- On completion submit your task using the issue tracker, and include the URL to your GitHub repository and the public URL of the working application
- All tasks must be submitted by end of day on the Tuesday before the class (class is on Wednesday)

### Week 1 [↗](./weeks/01.md)

*26th October, 2022*

#### 🪑 Presentation

In the Digital Product Jam, students will experience working in teams - designers and developers - to plan, implement, and deploy working digital products for our collaborating organizations - a hand-picked selection of Israeli "social good" not-for-profits.

Similarly to a real business environment, students will need to balance competing concerns that arise from working with a client, working in a team, and working with constraints like time and team abilities. Technical skills are required, but in no way sufficient, for delivering a digital product.

We will illustrate this broader picture of working on digital products in a business context, and focus on the fundamentals of how the course will be run and graded, who is teaching, and what actually will be taught in the course.

#### 🏗 Workshop

We will get all students setup with the development environment we require for the course. This will mean installing apps and other development dependencies on student machines, creation of accounts on some web services we will use, and pulling, running, and deploying code to ensure everyone has a working environment.

#### 🏠 Home

Students will start from a template to develop and deploy their own "About Me" page. From the base we provide, students will make edits and enhancements that demonstrate:

- A working development environment
- A rudimentary understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

The task builds on the workshop done in class, and additional home reading on fundamental web technologies.

### Week 2 [↗](./weeks/02.md)

*2nd November, 2022*

#### 🪑 Presentation

We are using the web as a delivery platform for our digital products in this course. But, what does that actually mean?

We will briefly review the history of the web in order to gain a basic understanding of the technologies we use to build web applications. Students will be exposed to fundamental web technologies, and shown how they are used to build applications via a series of demonstrations.

The purpose of the overview is to get a basic shared understanding of web technologies before we start using them to build increasingly more complex applications.

#### 🏗 Workshop

Each student will build an application that takes a dataset and presents it to a visitor. We will provide a list of data sources to choose from. The application needs to:

- Load data from a source into an internal representation
- Render the data to the user interface, using some type of HTML structure
- Enhance the presentation of the data using CSS
- Allow some basic data interaction by the visitor

#### 🏠 Home

Students will finish the data application started in the class workshop.

Additionally, we provide home reading and walkthroughs for the more advanced "libraries" and "frameworks" that we will start using from next week.

### Week 3 [↗](./weeks/03.md)

*9th November, 2022*

#### 🪑 Presentation

The vast majority of professional applications do not use "raw" HTML, CSS and JS, but rather use higher-level "libraries" and "frameworks". We will briefly discuss why this is the case, and then get into specifics with the technologies we will adopt for our work going forward. We will also review some of the tooling we have already seen (version control, CI/CD, issue tracking).

#### 🏗 Workshop

Each student will start building an application using our chosen libraries and frameworks. We will work on this same application over the coming weeks, **iterating** to add more functionality.

We will start by **re-implementing** our existing data application in the new framework. This basis will then be expanded on to introduce:

- Working with a database
- Authentication
- Access control
- Responsive design

#### 🏠 Home

Students will finalize a key area of their application - authentication - in a form that is commited and deployed.

Additionally, we provide home reading and walkthroughs for state management in React.

### Week 4 [↗](./weeks/04.md)

*16th November, 2022*

#### 🪑 Presentation

State management is one of the more complex aspects of web application development and there are a multitude of approaches. We will review and have some short demos of state management in the React ecosystem, with an emphasis on the types of scenarios we may encounter building an application around our data APIs. As part of this we will also introduce tools we can use to debug and verify application behavior.

#### 🏗 Workshop

Students continue on their application. We will work with students to discuss challenges and approaches, and ensure the scope of work is something that can be finalized by next week.

#### 🏠 Home

Finalize your application for review, closing off this stage of the course. We want to see meaningful usage of:

- Working with a database
- Authentication
- Access control
- Responsive design

### Week 5 [↗](./weeks/05.md)

*23th November, 2022*

> 📝 **Milestone**: Developers can build and deploy a web app using our tech stack, with integrations for user authentication, database access, and API access.

#### 🪑 Presentation

With the development class, we will review the last assignment, and do a recap over what we have learned so far.

We will then join the design class for introductions, and an overview of this next phase of the course.

#### 🏠 Home

Students take a product idea from the random generator and write a one-two page implementation document - what high level functionality is needed, what integrations are needed, identify potential problems.

## Section 2: Ship a working product in a team

**In this section of the course we will:**

- Learn about the clients we are working with for the course
- Work in teams to choose a client and define a "business problem" to present a product solution for
- Define a scope for the product solution, and the technical implementation of that scope, along with the design and user experience goals from the designers on the team
- Build and deploy a working product

### Week 6

*30th November, 2022*

> 📝 **Milestone**: We meet our clients and teams are formed.

#### 🪑 Presentation

Review of the home assignment.

Interactive session where we meet all of the "client" organizations who are working with us in the course. There will be plenty of time to ask questions and think about what type "business problems" could be addressed by "product solutions".

#### 🏠 Home

During this week we will form teams, and students will work in these teams going forward.

In preparation for that, the following needs to happen:

*By end of day Thursday December 1st*:

- Each student will submit her first and second choice of organizations to work with.
- Each student will submit names of students they would like to be teamed with (if any).

*By end of day Sunday 4th December*:

- All students will be notified of their team, and the client the team will work with.
- Each team prepares a document with ideas to bring to the next class, ready to start work.

### Week 7

*7th December, 2022*

#### 🪑 Presentation

All students sit in their teams.

We will work interactively on an ideation sprint.

#### 🏗 Workshop

Teams start work on their product decks and technical scope documents for the product solution they are working on.

#### 🏠 Home

Each team needs to finalize their product ideation deck and technical scope documents by end of day Monday 12th December. These will be submitted to the "clients" ahead of the next class.

### Week 8

*14th December, 2022*

> 📝 **Milestone**: Review of a teams current product solution.

#### 🪑 Presentation

Each team will present their current work to the "client" and the teaching team, with a Q and A session. This gives the teams early client feedback to sharpen their understanding of what needs to be built.

#### 🏗 Workshop

A workshop session focussed on user research and personas.

A workshop session foccused on defining an MVP and strategic narrative for a digital product.

#### 🏠 Home

Teams should work together to lock down their product scope, via product ideation decks and technical documents. They should be able to come to the next class and be ready to start implementation work.

### Week 9 - Holiday

*21st December, 2022*

### Week 10

*28th December, 2022*

#### 🪑 Presentation

A presentation on user flows and wireframes.

#### 🏗 Workshop

Teams start implementation work. Designers start on frontends (in a design tool like Figma). Developers start setting up their project and building out any basic functionality (what data do we need, how do we get it, what fundamental user interactions are required, etc.). Discussion is important so that design and development efforts are in the same genral direction.

#### 🏠 Home

Team designers work to have a user interface prototype ready for next class. They have shared this with the developers on their team before class. Developers finalize any basic infrastructure/wiring if their app, ready to start work in frontend in the next class.
